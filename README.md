## Installation

Copy analog-freq.js and analog-freq folder to the plugins directory of your FM-DX-webserver installation, then copy font.ttf to the <strong>web</strong> directory of your webserver, not the plugins directory.

Navigate to the plugins menu in the admin panel, and enable the plugin.

You can modify analog-freq.js to specify if you only want the font of the frequency to change. This is optional.
